### About me

I'm a Computer Vision Research Intern at <a href="https://www.magicleap.com">Magic Leap</a> in Zurich since November 2023, when I finished my Master's in robotics at ETH Zurich. My research interests lie at the intersection between geometry, 3D computer vision and deep learning, exploring their potential applications in real-world robotic systems. Specially, I am fascinatedabout multi-view reconstruction, neural implicit surface representations, large-scale localization and mapping, and scene understanding, although my enthusiasm spans the entirety of the computer vision domain.

I am currently looking for a PhD in 3D computer vision to futher develop my skills as a researcher and contribute to future groundbreaking work.
