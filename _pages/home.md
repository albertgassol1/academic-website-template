### About me

I'm a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.autonomousrobotslab.com">Autonomous Robots Lab</a>, where I do research on scene understanding and mapping for robotics. Previously, I interned at <a href="https://www.magicleap.com">Magic Leap</a> in Zurich, after finishing my Master's in robotics at ETH Zurich. 

My research interests lie at the intersection between geometry, 3D computer vision and deep learning, exploring their potential applications in real-world robotic systems. Specially, I am fascinated about multi-view reconstruction, neural implicit surface representations, large-scale localization and mapping, and scene understanding, although my enthusiasm spans the entirety of the computer vision domain.
